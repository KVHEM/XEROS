# Developing code for XEROS project.

## Synopsis

Recent European droughts are mostly evaluated within the context of hydroclimatic conditions of the second 
half of the 20th century. It is thus possible, that recent European drought events are less (or more) severe 
than previously thought. The XEROS project aims at (1) assessing the extremity of recent European drought events 
in the perspective of long (i.e., 500-year) benchmark period and (2) improving the process understanding of drought 
genesis. The underlying analysis will employ a multi-model reconstruction of hydrologic variables using the 
palaeoclimatic reconstructed driving data. Current state-of-the-art hydrologic/land surface models will be used 
to estimate spatio-temporal dynamics of the surface and subsurface water component. This will enable an improved 
understanding of historical characterisation of large scale drought events and exploratory analysis of the governing 
atmospheric parameters influencing the genesis of droughts. Better understanding of the uncertainties in the past 
will allow to project future hydroclimatic conditions across Europe more reliably.
